# Meeting Notebook

A single-page, aesthetic meeting companion that lets you capture meeting notes, keep track of todos, and jot down side ideas without losing focus.

## Features

- **Meeting note tab** with a guided form, quick template button, tag for meeting focus, and a searchable history.
- **To-do tab** that supports due dates, priorities, completion state, filters, and a live counter of outstanding tasks.
- **Side notes tab** acting as a scratchpad with autosave and a one-click clear button.
- **Theme toggle** between a bright and a dark mode plus persistent storage through `localStorage`.

## Getting started

Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser. All data is stored locally in your browser, so there is nothing to deploy or configure.
